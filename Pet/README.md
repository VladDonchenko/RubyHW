1.Install rubies on your computer(This link can help you https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-installation.htm).

2.Copy all the contents of this repository and launch the terminal. 

3.Use the cd command to go to the pet folder, and use the command "ruby Tamagochi.rb" to start the game.

4.Enjoy the game:)
